Background texture was taken from the video and edited a bit in photoshop.

Bump map shader was taken from class, A toggle was attempted but couldnt be completed.

LUT table shader was taken from class, A toggle was attempted but couldnt be completed.

The Forcefield was done using the rim lighting shader from class, but was modified to have a toggle as well as use a texture.
The toggle was done by using the toggle example from the decal shader, and it toggles between an empty, black color, to the finished rim.
I used one of unity's textures and applied itto the albedo.
Rim lighting was done by getting the dot product of the view direction and the normal, subtracting that by one and putting that on the emission
